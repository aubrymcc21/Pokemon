Project Title: Pokemon

Date: October 17, 2019

Project Description: This is a very simple mimic game of Pokemon written in Java. This program will show a main menu with theme music playing and three buttons. The quit button exits the game, the Instructions button displays a prompt with controls, and the Play button begins the game. Upon playing, you will see a chat box with Professor Oak. After some dialogue, you click on which Pokemon you'd like to select, and press OK in the prompt with "Yes" in the text box to confirm your choice. After this and a bit more dialogue, you will see a rudimentary town surrounded by trees. Walk over the sign to see what it says. The first area is a demonstration of boundaries; you cannot walk through the houses or the trees bordering the map. To progress, go to the opening in the trees at the top of the screen. Walk through the grass to eventually spawn a Pokemon battle. Click the different menu buttons to fight, check your bag, select other Pokemon, or flee. After defeating the other Pokemon, a prompt will display thanking you for playing, signaling the end of the game.

To Run: java .\Driver.java

This program requires a Java IDE of some kind to run. It was originally tested both with BlueJ and Visual Studio Code. The music is not owned by me.
